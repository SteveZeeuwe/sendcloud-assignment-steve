## Step one; indexing the assignment

The first thing I do when I get an assignment is making sure I understand what is asked and that I am able to do what is asked. In this case it was fairly straightforward; the requirements are clear enough and I made sure that I had all the files needed to build the solution.

From experience I knew it would be handy to have the XD file open so I can inspect sizes, fonts, colors and so on. Unfortunately XD has been moved into 'maintenance mode' since Adobe tried to aquire Figma. This means that Adobe has made it more difficult to download XD.. I actually had to get a subscription to be able to download XD, whereas previously it was a separate product dowload.

Getting the subscription took over 12 hours to come throught, so this delayed my start quite a bit. I would like to suggest to look into moving away from XD for future applicants.

> Fun fact; the Adobe-Figma proposed merger has very recently come to a halt as they could not get regulatory approval, so XD's death was in vain.

## Step two; decide on the process

The goal of this project is not to have the files of a working range calculator on a landingpage but rather to display my skill level and way of working. For that reason I find it important to make a conscious decision on how I'm going to work on this project and how I can best showcase the entire process; not only the final result.

I chose to use git and keep track of my (thought)process by writing this document.

The reason why I decided to use git is twofold:

1. It shows how I use git; an invaluable tool for collaborative development and version control.
2. It provides a chronolical timeline of my development as opposed to only a final solution. As iterative development is important in agile environments I decided to use git to show my approach / iterations.

The reason why I decided to write this process document is also twofold;

1. The Process Document is easier to read than opening a bunch of commits.
2. This document allows me to also write about what I did _not_ commit; this can be just as important if you want to get a feel of my way of working.
