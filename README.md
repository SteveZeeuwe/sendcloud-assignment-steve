# Sendcloud's Front-end Development Assignment

## Introduction

This repository contains my (Steve Zeeuwe) process and solution of an assignment sent by Sendcloud for the role of (senior) Front-End Developer. The goal of this assignment is to provide insight into my way of working and technical skill level.

For that reason I decided to create the [process document](PROCESS.md) which details my process.

The rest of this README is in service of the assignment; an explanation, how to run the project, and so on.

## The assignment

The assignment is to turn a [provided design](/workfiles/designs/landing-example.png) of a landing page into code by using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The landing page also includes a [functional battery range calculator](/workfiles/designs/reactivity-example.gif). At the end of the README you can find the list of requirements. For convenience I shortened some of the points and turned them into a checklist so we can keep track of their status.

## Online demo

I will upload the final project to my own website. Technically my own website is not Netlify or Vercel, but I assume it has the same effect and my personal website is cooler anyway.

## Running locally

        Assumption: you have GIT installed.

If you want to run the project locally, follow the steps below;

-   Clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:SteveZeeuwe/sendcloud-assignment-steve.git`
-   Open the index.html file with your favorite browser to run the project on your machine.

## Developing locally

        Assumption: you have Node.js and npm installed.

The project is as vanilla as can be, apart from SCSS and PostCSS. If you want to make changes to the CSS these tools are mandatory to use as they build the final `main.css` file that is loaded. Fortunately it is very easy to do so;

-   From the root of the project, run `npm install`
-   During development, run `npm run dev`. This starts a script that compiles the scss and then runs postcss on top of it. It uses a watcher so it re-compiles every time you save your changes.
-   If you want to make go to production, run `npm run build` to create a more optimized version of `main.css`.

## List of requirements

### Functionals

-   [x] Clicking on the arrow-down icon in the first hero section should point the user to the
        battery range calculator
-   [x] Implement a battery range calculator for two types of the Tesla Model S that
        displays the maximum distance covered by each type of car, based on the user
        choices for speed, temperature (with and without heating/cooling), and wheel size.
        It should have the following controls
    -   [x] A range of speeds from `70` to `140` km/h using steps of `10km`;
    -   [x] A range of temperatures from `-10ยบ` to `40ยบ` using steps of `10ยบ`
    -   [x] A toggle for air conditioner/heating system.
        -   [x] The temperature should affect how this component is displayed
    -   [x] A wheel size selection with `19"` and `21"`.
-   [x] Use the JSON files from the `data/` directory to build the calculator behavior

### Non-functionals

-   [x] The project must be written in HTML, JavaScript and CSS, _without using any other
        library or framework_
-   [x] Make the design responsive;
-   [ ] It must be compatible with modern browsers, but also include IE11 and non-Chromium Edge.
-   [ ] Include a `README.md` file with instructions of how to run your final project.
-   [ ] It must provide a usable version of the project whenever _JavaScript is disabled_.
-   [ ] Make sure that the project is SEO-friendly by using proper HTML semantics.
-   [ ] All resources must be optimized for content delivery

#### Bonus points

-   [x] Use animations to make the interactions with the UI more fluid.
-   [x] Make your project fully responsive without sacrificing either usability _or_ accessibility
-   [x] Keep an eye on performance and apply optimizations as much as you can.
-   [ ] Deploy it as a static website on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
-   [ ] Make sure your project is [well-tested](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)
